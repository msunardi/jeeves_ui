Check .less auto-builds:
$ cd Projects/uikit
$ npm run watch

The jeeves custom css are named: uikit.jeeves.*.css
The built css directory is symlinked in Linux and the .css files are manually copied to static/main/css
Do not commit the symlink directory - copy the .css to the static/main/css directory and commit that.
